                    I went with my girlfriend in my freshman year at Cornell and had a really nice time. We walked through the streets and had their famous mac and cheese. - Teddy Park

                    I love getting apples and apple donuts. The food is delicious and is worth the wait! I am a junior student now but I have been going since my Freshman year.  - Haley Kim

                <blockquote cite="Kelly Foo">
                    I actually did not go in my freshman year. I went in my sophomore year and I wonder why I never went in my freshman year! It's so much fun! Dress pretty! Take lots of pictures! Eat good food! - Kelly Foo

                <blockquote cite="Timothy Kim">
                    I tried the apple cider for 2$. It was super sweet. I also had the apple honey glazed chicken wings! Make sure you bring cash with you. - Timothy Kim

                <blockquote cite="Sarah Rim">
                    I am a Sophomore transfer and I went to check out the festival with my other sophomore transfer friends. It was worth an experience but I don't think there's anything much special to it. I would not go again next year. - Sarah Rim

                <blockquote cite="Celina Kim">
                    I went with my boyfriend and it was a really fun date! I highly recommend checking out all the food vendors first before buying the food, because there are so many options. - Celina Kim

                <blockquote cite="Justin Kim">
                    I think it's worth the experience to go once, but my guyfriends and I did not do much. We looked around and realied the lineups were too long and came back earlier than we had planned. - Justin Kim
